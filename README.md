# **IrisuControl**

A clean and simple multi-project script runner built with Electron.  
Manage multiple Node.js projects in one place, run scripts with one click, and organize everything with project groups.

## **Why I built IrisuControl**

Working with several projects at once quickly became a hassle.  
I constantly found myself:

- opening multiple VS Code windows  
- switching between terminals  
- manually running scripts in each project  
- losing track of which script was running where  

It was inefficient and messy — so I built **IrisuControl** to fix that.
